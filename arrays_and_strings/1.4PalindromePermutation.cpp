/**
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of the letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

notes:
- ignore spaces

solutions:
- brute force: generate every single permutation, check each one if it's a permutation (not coding this lol)
- hash map, check every char has an even count, except at most one char
- sort and check that every num has even count, except at most one char

Ex:
Tact Coa

bool hashmap(string s) {
}
