/**
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20' you may assume the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string

Example:
"Mr John Smith    ", 13
"Mr%20John%20Smith"

Solutions:
- Copy to a new string
- Each time find a space, move everything over 
- Count each space, then go backwards and move everything to the exact correct place
